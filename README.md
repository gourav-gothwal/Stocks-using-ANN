An **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model that predicts **whether a stock's price will go up ⬆️ or down ⬇️** based on historical market data.  
The goal is to demonstrate **deep learning in finance** using an **end-to-end ML pipeline** from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- **Binary Classification** → Up 📈 / Down 📉 prediction  
- **End-to-End Workflow** → Preprocessing → ANN Training → Evaluation  
- **Visualization** → Accuracy & Loss curves, Confusion Matrix, Prediction Plots  
- **Educational** → Well-commented Jupyter Notebook for easy learning  
- **Customizable** → Can be adapted to any stock dataset
